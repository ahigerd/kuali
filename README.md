# Comments

I noticed that the simulator is not required to check to see if the elevator is going in the right direction when
checking for candidates that will pass by the requested floor. All real elevators I've seen make this check, and I have
opted to include this in my implementation because it is more realistic, more efficient, and also simpler to implement
given the structures I've designed.
